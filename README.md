# DbGaP FHIR API Docs

This is the documentation repository for the [dbGaP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/) [FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir/) API. ([API base URL](http://dbgap-api.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/x1))

dbGaP is the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes.<br/>
FHIR is HL7's REST API standard for electronic medical data.  

* [**Quickstart**](quickstart.md)
* [**Mapping dbGaP concepts to FHIR concepts**](https://dbgap-api-preview.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/fhir-mapping/interactive/)
* **Notebooks** (Coming soon)

## Prerequisites

You should already have a basic understanding of FHIR - especially
before working through the Notebooks. The [FHIR Exercises
repo](https://github.com/NIH-ODSS/fhir-exercises) from ODSS worked
well for our team in the version they had when we used them. (However,
by linking to them we do not imply that they are still good or that
NCBI or the United States Federal Government endorses them. Use at
your own risk. The same goes for all links on this page.)

For the Notebooks, you should also understand [how Notebooks
work](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/) and [Pandas
dataframes](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/dsintro.html#dataframe).

## Maintenance
The team is focused on adding features and data.
So we are not fixing issues in the documentation.
This means it is outdated with no commitment
to update it. Being optimists, we hope to update
it someday, but we cannot say if that time will
ever come.

## Issues
We are aware that the current documentation is
[low quality and there is not enough of it](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/4151-there-s-an-old-joke---um-two-elderly-women-are).
If you report a bug or request a feature, it will probably be overlooked
and neglected.

The CSV download for the interactive concept mapping does
not handle quoting correctly. You'll need to hand-edit it.

## Contact
If, despite knowing it is nearly equivalent
to shouting into the void (see above), you still wish to contact
the team, you can reach the technical lead via email:
*eric (d)o(t) moyer at nih.gov.* Your email will then join the
thousands of other unopened items languishing in his inbox Limbo.
