# DbGaP FHIR API Docs

This is the documentation repository for the [dbGaP FHIR API](http://dbgap-api.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/x1).

## Available Documentation
* [**Quickstart**](quickstart.md)
* [**Mapping dbGaP concepts to FHIR concepts**](https://dbgap-api-preview.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/fhir-mapping/interactive/)

## Maintenance
The team is focused on adding features and data.
So we are not fixing issues in the documentation.
This means it is outdated with no commitment
to update it. Being optimists, we hope to update
it someday, but we cannot say if that time will
ever come.

## Issues
We are aware that the current documentation is
[low quality and there is not enough of it](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/4151-there-s-an-old-joke---um-two-elderly-women-are).
If you report a bug or request a feature, it will probably be overlooked
and neglected.

The CSV download for the interactive concept mapping does
not handle quoting correctly. You'll need to hand-edit it.

## Contact
If, despite knowing it is nearly equivalent
to shouting into the void (see above), you still wish to contact
the team, you can reach the technical lead via email:

thousands of other unopened items languishing in his inbox Limbo.
